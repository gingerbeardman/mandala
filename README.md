A little playground for testing pixel logic patterns.

Generating a screen takes a couple of seconds on hardware as it requires per-pixel processing of the entire 400x240 screen = 96,000 pixels. As such, these effects are not currently suitable for real-time use, but should rather be pre-rendered or cached in some way. There may be some optimisations that can be made to improve the situation.
